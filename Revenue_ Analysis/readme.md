# Tech Company Revenue Analysis

## Project Overview:

A tech company sought to increase its revenue by analyzing sales data form its sales representatives between 2019 and 2020 across Asia,  UK, and USA. Despite targeting thousands of customers, only a small percentage made purchases of the specific product. The goal was to identify shortcomings in sales and marketing strategies, boost revenue, and drive sales growth. This would help the company enhance the efficiency of future campaigns and improve its overall conversion rate.

## Key Metrics:
1) Sales Volume: 3,264
2) Total Revenue: 127.41M
3) Sum of revenue by products:
   - Smartphone: 78.92M(61.94%)
   - Assessories: 21.14M(16.59%)
   - Tablets: 14.18M(11.13%)
   - Laptops: 13.18M(10.34%)
4) Average Age: 34
5) Region: Asia, UK, USA
   
## Tasks completed:
Data ingestion, data processing/cleaning, visualizations and dashboarding.

The dashboard provides a clear view of trends across different demographic groups, making the decision-making process data-driven and actionable.

## Key Insights:
### 1) Age-Based Sales: Sales performance analyzed by age group of the sales representatives:
The sales for the 20-30 age group are lower due to less experience, while sales for the 30-40 and 40-50 age groups are higher because of greater experience and established client relationships.

### 2) Revenue by Product: Breakdown of revenue based on individual product categories.
- Smartphone: 78.92M(61.94%)
- Assessories: 21.14M(16.59%)
- Tablets: 14.18M(11.13%)
- Laptops: 13.18M(10.34%)

Cellular contacts had a far higher success rate (15%) compared to telephone (5%), implying a clear preference for mobile communication.

### 3) Number of Contacts:
Overall, most conversions happened with 1-3 contacts, with diminishing returns after five or more contacts. Over-contacting seems ineffective and might even negatively affect the campaign.
Housing Loan Holders:

Customers without housing loans had a marginally lower success rate (10.8%) compared to those with a loan (11.7%).

### 4) Educational Background:
Interestingly, illiterate customers had a 23.5% campaign success rate, followed by university degree holders at 13.7%. This suggests targeting illiterate customers may require specific messaging strategies.

## Recommendations:
1) Focus on Students and Retirees: Since these groups show higher conversion rates, marketing materials should be more tailored to their specific needs.

2) Timing is Critical: Concentrate efforts in March and December when success rates peak.

3) Optimize Contact Methods: Focus more on cellular outreach, as it outperforms landline communication.

4) Refine Contact Frequency: Limit follow-ups to no more than 3-4 contacts to maximize efficiency while avoiding negative responses.

5) Customize messaging based on education and financial status: Create differentiated marketing strategies for illiterate and university-educated customers, as their responses to campaigns vary significantly. Additionally, consider focusing on customers with housing loans as they may have more disposable income for investments.

With the help of this analysis, the bank can expect a higher conversion rate, reduced marketing costs, and better targeting of high-potential customers, leading to more effective and efficient marketing campaigns.
