# Tech Company Revenue Analysis

## Project Overview:

A tech company sought to increase its revenue by analyzing sales data form its sales representatives between 2019 and 2020 across Asia,  UK, and USA. Despite targeting thousands of customers, only a small percentage made purchases of the specific product. The goal was to identify shortcomings in sales and marketing strategies, boost revenue, and drive sales growth. This would help the company enhance the efficiency of future campaigns and improve its overall conversion rate.

## Key Metrics:
1) Sales Volume: 3,264
2) Total Revenue: 127.41M
3) Sum of revenue by products:
   - Smartphone: 78.92M(61.94%)
   - Assessories: 21.14M(16.59%)
   - Tablets: 14.18M(11.13%)
   - Laptops: 13.18M(10.34%)
4) Average Age: 34
5) Region: Asia, UK, USA
   
## Tasks completed:

The dashboard provides a clear view of trends across different demographic groups, making the decision-making process data-driven and actionable.

## Key Insights:
### 1) Age-Based Sales: Sales performance analyzed by age group of the sales representatives:
The sales for the 20-30 age group are lower due to less experience, while sales for the 30-40 and 40-50 age groups are higher because of greater experience and established client relationships.

### 2) Revenue by Product: Breakdown of revenue based on individual product categories.
- Smartphone: 78.92M(61.94%)
- Assessories: 21.14M(16.59%)
- Tablets: 14.18M(11.13%)
- Laptops: 13.18M(10.34%)

Most of the revenue generated by Smartphone and Assessories related to Smartphones, Tablets and Laptops. 

### 3) Top Revenue-Generating Sales Representative: The sales representative with the highest revenue contribution.
Andrew Tan with 13.53M in sales and Louis Ng with 11.69M together accounted for 19% of total sales.

### 4) Average Revenue by Country: The average revenue generated across different countries.
The top two countries are from Asia, while the third and fourth are from the UK and the USA, respectively, indicating that a large number of customers are based in the Asia region.
